# MSU_STARX_SYSTEMINTEGRATION

## Intro

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

The things you need before installing the software.

* Arduino IDE
* Arduino Due with Atmel SAM3X8E ARM Cortex-M3 CPU
* C++ compiler
* MSU STARX exoskeleton suit
* doxygen
* doxywizard

### Installation and Execution

A step by step guide that will tell you how to get the development environment up and running.

```
$ Drag Arduino folder containing required C++ libraries into local machine.
$ On Mac OS X this would be found at Documents>Arduino.
$ Open MSU_STARX_SYSTEMINTEGRATION.ino in Arduino IDE.
$ Connect from Computer a micro usb to Arduino Due found on MSU STARX exoskeleton suit.
$ Set in Arduino IDE on the top of the screen Tools>Board to Arduino Due Programming Port.
$ Click Verify and Upload buttons on Arduino IDE.
$ MSU STARX exoskeleton suit will execute commands.
```
